# Convolutional Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis in Brazilian Portuguese texts

This system is an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network to extract sentiments of texts in Brazilian Portuguese language. 

The model and architecture is based on [Kim (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) work, several modifications had to be made in order to adapt for Brazilian Portuguese texts and to get the output and performance desired.

## Technologies

  - [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/ "TensorFlow") is the deep learning framework used to train, test and validate the model. 
  - [**HPCC Platform**](https://hpccsystems.com/ "Home Page|HPCC Systems") is used to pre-process text data into the format that the model expects.
